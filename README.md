This project aims to present galgames(also known as visual novels) on webpage, full-screen or in a certain element of DOM.

The first target is to construct the basic structure system so as to make simple and short presentations of visual novels, which can be integrated in web articles. And this will be released as NovelScript-Light in a file called "NovelScript.light.js".

The second target is to complete features of a visual novel reader, and the lecture of scripts(those of galgames) from external test files will be formed, and a framework will also be released so that normal user can easily build there own web galgames with NovelScript. This will be released as NovelScript, with a framework(May be called "NovelScript-UI").

The third target is to do with the server side, using python, php and mysql to make the web game a on line game, so that scripts will be stored in sql, both user account and comment/danmaku. This will be released as NovelScript-Server
